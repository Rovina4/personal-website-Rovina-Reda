      <h1>Bio:</h1>
      <h2>I'm Rovina Reda</h2> 
        <p>I am 18 years old. In major  Digital Media Design. </p>
        <p>My favorite thing that we made in the university is rebranding, making a logo, designing posters, and videography. </p>
        <p>I improved in these things through the assistants and tutors in my college and by the help of my friends that graduated many years ago and work in the same major. </p>
        <p>I can remember that after finishing this beautiful semester, I joined in many activities to help me be better in videography and branding ideas. </p>
        <p>Another thing that i enjoy is communicating with people alot and never sitting at home all the time.  </p>
        <p>Because sitting at home makes me have depression and sadness all the time, making me cry,overthink, and get angry with people around me for no reason. </p>
        <p>Sometimes, when i get bored of everything, start reading. i enjoy reading especially history books and non fiction.</p>
        <p> That is all about me.</p>
